Week 1 GitHub Project Requirements

Project Milestone - Phase 1

-Model Selection: Choose two models relevant to your project [done and added to models folde]
-Conversion Implementation: Create scripts that convert models to ONNX format
-Baseline Profiling: Measure and document inference time, memory, and model size
-GitHub Documentation:
    Detailed README with model architecture descriptions
    Conversion workflow documentation
    Baseline performance metrics
    Initial deployment considerations

PROJECT MILESTONE - Phase 1 - Edge Deployment Planning & GitHub
Setup: Identify an edge AI application scenario for your individual project from the
sample project options. Define resource constraints, user requirements, and performance targets. Create a project plan that includes model selection, optimization
approach, and deployment strategy. Initialize a GitHub repository with appropriate
README, structure, and documentation templates as specified in the GitHub requirements.

PROJECT MILESTONE - Phase 1 - Model Conversion & Analysis: Select
and convert two modern AI models to ONNX format. Perform basic profiling to identify resource requirements and potential bottlenecks. Create a baseline performance
report documenting memory usage, inference time, and accuracy metrics. Commit all
code, configuration files, and documentation to your GitHub repository with appropriate version control and documentation.
