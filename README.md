## üöÄ Individual Project

Throughout the 5-week course, each student will build a multimodal edge AI application that runs efficiently on standard CPU hardware. The project will progressively develop through weekly milestones:

**The Edge AI Deployment Challenge:**
- Create an AI application that runs efficiently on standard CPU hardware without specialized accelerators
- Demonstrate significant optimization through quantization, pruning, and architecture modifications
- Implement edge-optimized generative AI capabilities (text or image generation)
- Deploy advanced computer vision capabilities with real-time performance
- Enable efficient speech processing that works reliably
- Design resource-aware applications with responsive user experiences
- Document all processes thoroughly in a well-maintained GitHub repository

## üîç Selected Project

Choose one of the following project options to implement throughout the course:

1. **Edge AI Assistant**: A desktop-based AI assistant that runs entirely on CPU without cloud dependencies
2. **Portable Document Intelligence**: A document analysis system that can run offline on a standard laptop
3. **Edge Creative Studio**: A content creation tool with on-device generative AI capabilities
4. **Smart Monitoring System**: A privacy-preserving monitoring system that performs all processing on-device
5. **Field Research Assistant**: An offline-capable field research tool for scientific data collection and analysis

I have selected project number 2 for the purposes of this class.
