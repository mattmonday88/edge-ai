## üöÄ Individual Project

Throughout the 5-week course, each student will build a multimodal edge AI application that runs efficiently on standard CPU hardware. The project will progressively develop through weekly milestones:

I have selected project number 2 for the purposes of this class.

**Portable Document Intelligence**: A document analysis system that can run offline on a standard laptop

**The Edge AI Deployment Challenge:**
- Create an AI application that runs efficiently on standard CPU hardware without specialized accelerators
- Demonstrate significant optimization through quantization, pruning, and architecture modifications
- Implement edge-optimized generative AI capabilities (text or image generation)
- Deploy advanced computer vision capabilities with real-time performance
- Enable efficient speech processing that works reliably
- Design resource-aware applications with responsive user experiences
- Document all processes thoroughly in a well-maintained GitHub repository
