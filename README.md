## üìö Course Overview

This repository contains materials for the "Deploying Edge AI" master's level course, which introduces students to the principles and practices of deploying advanced AI models at the edge. Over 5 intensive weeks, students will learn how to optimize, convert, and deploy popular generative AI, computer vision, and speech recognition models using ONNX and its CPUExecutionProvider.

The course emphasizes practical approaches to delivering AI capabilities on resource-constrained devices without specialized hardware, focusing on strategies that leverage standard CPU capabilities found in most computing environments.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Convert modern AI models from various frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX) to ONNX format
- Apply advanced optimization techniques including quantization, pruning, and architecture modifications
- Deploy efficient generative AI models (text and image) on edge devices 
- Implement real-time computer vision applications that run entirely on CPU
- Create speech recognition systems optimized for edge deployment
- Develop multimodal edge AI applications with responsive user interfaces
- Measure and optimize performance metrics for edge deployment
- Follow professional software development practices for edge AI deployment
